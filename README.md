# viva-new-vegas-wabbajack-test

Viva New Vegas now has an official Wabbajack available, so this repository is depreciated.

Now supports both the Viva New Vegas Base and Extended edition, updated February 4th 2024.

# This is incomplete, and the game will not run correctly without performing these steps:
## After Wabbajack finishes installing:
	1. Run the "FNV BSA Decompressor" program through "_FNV BSA Decompressor" folder 
	    	Set output folder to the "_FNV BSA Decompressor" folder in the /mods/ folder of your modlist instal
	2. Copy the "NVHR" folder from New Vegas Heap Replacer into New Vegas's Data folder
	        You can do this by double clicking the mod in Mod Organizer, clicking Open Mod in Explorer, then copying and pasting the "NVHR" folder into New Vegas's Data folder, usually in /Steam/steamapps/common/Fallout New Vegas/Data. 
	3. Run the 4GB FNV Patch through Mod Organizer
	4. All set. Should be able to launch the game through the "New Vegas" option. 	


# To-Do
N/A 
Viva New Vegas now has an official Wabbajack available. If that one goes down again, send me a message and I'll update this one to the newest version.
This Wabbajack also has the benefit of having BOTH the Viva New Vegas Base and Viva New Vegas Extended editions, unlike the official one.
